# Diagnostic Log and Trace

Build and Test status: ![build and test status](https://travis-ci.org/jardous/dlt-daemon.svg?branch=master)

## Overview
This component provides a log and trace interface, based on the
standardised protocol specified in the AUTOSAR standard 4.0 DLT.  
This software can be used by GENIVI components and other applications as logging framework.

DLT basically consists of 3 components:  
- __DLT Library__: Enables DLT logging for DLT user applications and temporary storage of log messages if daemon isn't available.
- __DLT Daemon__: Receiving log messages from DLT user applications and temporary storage of log messages if client isn't available. Transmit log messages to DLT Client and response to control messages.
- __DLT Client__: Receiving and storage of log messages from DLT Daemon into one single trace file and sending control message

Furthermore, the repository contains several adaptors, console utilities as well as test applications.

## Build and install

The following packages need to be installed in order to be able to build and install DLT daemon:
```
- cmake
- zlib
- dbus
```

On Ubuntu those dependencies can be installed with the following command:
`sudo apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev`

To build and install the DLT daemon, follow these steps:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
optional: sudo make install
optional: sudo ldconfig`
```

In order to change these options, you can modify these values
with cmake, do the appropriate changes in CmakeList.txt or via
the commandline for cmake

Change a value with: cmake -D<Variable>=<Value>, E.g.
```
cmake .. -DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON -DWITH_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
```

## Documentation
Specific documentation can be found in the following files:

- [ReleaseNotes](ReleaseNotes.md)
- [Glossary](doc/dlt_glossary.md)
- [For Developers](doc/dlt_for_developers.md)
- [Logstorage](doc/dlt_offline_logstorage.md)
- [MultiNode](doc/dlt_multinode.md)

All text based documentation will be replaced with by Markdown-based documentation for convinient access.

- DLT Compilation of all documentation: doc/dlt_book.txt

### API Documentation
The API documentation is generated with _doxygen_.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..
make doc
```

### Manpages
- dlt-daemon(1)
- dlt.conf(5)
- dlt-system(1)
- dlt-system.conf(5)
- dlt-convert(1)
- dlt-sortbytimestamp(1)
- dlt-receive(1)
- dlt-logstorage-ctrl(1)
- dlt-dbus (1)      TBD
- dlt-dbus.conf (5) TBD
- dlt-cdh (1)       TBD
- dlt-kpi (1)       TBD

The man pages are generated with _asciidoc_.

If the man pages are changed the following command must be executed.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..
make doc-man
```

The generated man pages overwrite the existing ones.

## Contribution

Start working, best practice is to commit smaller, compilable pieces during the work that makes it easier to handle later on.

If you want to commit your changes, create a _Pull Request_ in Github.

### Coding Rules

Before contributing code, run uncrustify to harmonize code style.

Configuration: util/uncrustify.cfg
uncrustify version: 0.68_f

## Known issues

List of open issues can be found on [Github](https://github.com/GENIVI/dlt-daemon/issues)

- DLT library: Usage of dlt_user_log_write_float64() and DLT_FLOAT64() leads to "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" on ARM target.
- DLT library: Nested calls to DLT_LOG_ ... are not supported, and will lead to a deadlock.
- For Non linux platforms [eg: QNX] IPC supported is UNIX_SOCKET. For Linux Platforms both IPC FIFO and UNIX_SOCKET are supported
