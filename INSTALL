|==============================================================================================

In order to change these options, you can modify these values
with ccmake, do the appropriate changes in CmakeList.txt or via
the commandline for cmake

- Change a value with: cmake -D<Variable>=<Value>
- Example: cmake -DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON -DWITH_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

Create Man pages
----------------
The man pages are generated and installed during the standard build and install.

After installation they are located in <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/share/man.

The man pages are generated with asciidoc.
If the man pages are changed the following command must be executed.

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..
make doc-man
----

The generated man pages overwrite the existing ones.

Create manuals documentation
----------------------------
The manuals are generated with asciidoc.

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..
make doc-manuals
----

You will find the generated documents in build/doc/manuals.

Create api documentation
------------------------
The API documentation is generated with doxygen.

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..
make doc
----

You will find the generated documents in build/doc/DOC_DLT.

Generation of systemd unit files
--------------------------------
DLT provides cmake files to create unit files for systemd. These can be found in the systemd directory.
In systemd/CMakeLists.txt you can modify some values, e.g. the port for dlt-adaptor-udp.
By default the generation of unit files with cmake is disabled. Please follow these steps to enable the generation:

* Change into the root directory of DLT-daemon
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake -DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON ..

You find the generated unit files in build/systemd. They are installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/systemd/system when make install is run.

Git configuration
-----------------
It is important to set the name of the user and the email of the user for all git instances on the system:

----
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
----

If you are behind a proxy you have to set up the Git proxy configuration, e.g.

----
git config --global http.proxy $http_proxy
----

Checkout the code from the OSS Git repository.

----
git clone http://git.projects.genivi.org/dlt-daemon.git
----

Working on the code & contribution
----------------------------------
Get an overview of all branches:

----
git branch -a
----

Switch to the branch you want to work on (see versioning scheme, the master is the feature branch) and verify that it has switched.

----
git checkout <remote branch>
git branch -a
----

Best practice is to create a local branch based on the remote branch:

----
git checkout -b <local branch> <remote branch>
----

Start working, best practice is to commit smaller, compilable pieces during the work that makes it easier to handle later on.

If you want to commit your changes, send them to the auto-dlt list, you can create a patch like this:

----
git format-patch -s <remote branch>
----

This creates a set of patches (one patch per commit) that shall be published via the mailing list. The patches will be discussed, merged & uploaded on the git.

Please do not forget to document your changes:
- write a manual for new components or adapt manuals to the changes you have made
- in case you have added a new program please write a man page for it
- if you have added something to the DLT API please remember to provide Doxygen comments
