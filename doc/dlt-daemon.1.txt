NAME
----
dlt-daemon - Diagnostic log and trace daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dlt-daemon* [-h] [-d] [-c filename] [-t directory] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The DLT daemon is the central place where logs and traces are gathered
from different applications, stored temporarily or permanently and
transferred to a DLT client application, which can run directly on the
GENIVI system or more likely on a external tester device.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Display a short help text.

*-d*::
    Daemonize, needed in System V init systems.

*-c*::
    Load an alternative configuration file. By default the configuration
    file /etc/dlt.conf is loaded.

*-t*::
    Directory for local fifo and user-pipes (Default: /tmp)
    (Applications wanting to connect to a daemon using a
    custom directory need to be started with the environment
    variable DLT_PIPE_DIR set appropriately)

*-p*::
    Port to monitor for incoming requests (Default: 3490)
    (Applications wanting to connect to a daemon using a custom
    port need to be started with the environment variable
    DLT_DAEMON_TCP_PORT set appropriately)

EXAMPLES
--------
Start DLT daemon in background mode::
*dlt-daemon -d*

Start DLT daemon with own configuration::
*dlt-daemon -c ~/my-dlt-configuration.cfg*
