  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  Version 2.1, February 1999
  .
  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  .
  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]
  .
  Preamble
  .
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  .
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
  .
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
  these things.
  .
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  .
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  .
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  .
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
  introduced by others.
  .
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  .
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and   
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
  libraries into non-free programs.
