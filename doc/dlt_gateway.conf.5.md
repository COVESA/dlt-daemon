% DLT_GATEWAY.CONF(5)

# NAME

**dlt_gateway.conf** - DLT configuration file for gateway

# DESCRIPTION

The configuration file dlt_gateway.conf allows to configure the different runtime behaviour of gateway in Multinode feature.

The configuration file is written in an INI file format and contains information about different connected passive nodes.

If Multinode feature is enabled, dlt-daemon loads by default the configuration file /etc/dlt_gateway.conf.

An alternative configuration file can be loaded by changing `GatewayConfigFile` in dlt.conf(5).

# GENERAL SECTION

### Interval

Time interval for reconnection to passive Node in second.

    Default: 1

# PASSIVENODE SECTION

Each passive node’s connection parameters are specified in a unique numbered separate section

([PassiveNode{1,2, …N}]).

    Example: [PassiveNode1]

### IPaddress

                when it receives a connection request.

### Timeout

Stop connecting to passive node, if not successful after 10 retries.

After <Timeout> of retries, the connection to passive Node is marked as DISABLED.
