# NAME

**dlt-system.conf** - DLT system process configuration file

# DESCRIPTION

The DLT system logging process is the central application, which logs system information from the platform. It provides the features
filetransfer, syslog adapater, logging of any kind of files and
procfilesystem logger. The individual features can be enabled and
disabled in the configuration file.

The configuration file dlt-system.conf allows to configure the different runtime behaviour of dlt-system. The configuration file is loaded during startup of dlt-system.

dlt-system loads by default the configuration file  /etc/dlt-system.conf.
An alternative configuration file can be loaded with the option -c.
