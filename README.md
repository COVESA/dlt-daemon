# Diagnostic Log and Trace

## Overview
This component provides a log and trace interface, based on the
standardised protocol specified in the AUTOSAR standard 4.0 DLT.
This software can be used by GENIVI components and other applications as
logging facility providing

- the DLT shared library
- the DLT daemon
- the DLT daemon adaptors
- the DLT client console utilities
- the DLT test applications
- the DLT unit tests

The DLT daemon is the central component in GENIVI, which gathers all
logs and traces from the DLT user applications. The logs and traces
can optionally be directly written to a file in the ECU. The DLT daemon
forwards all logs and traces to a connected DLT client.
The DLT client can send control messages to the daemon, e.g. to set
individual log levels of applications and contexts or get the list of
applications and contexts registered in the DLT daemon.

## Known issues
- DLT library: Usage of dlt_user_log_write_float64() and DLT_FLOAT64() leads to "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" on ARM target.
- DLT library: Nested calls to DLT_LOG_ ... are not supported, and will lead to a deadlock.
