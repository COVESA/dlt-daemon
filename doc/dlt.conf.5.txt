NAME
----
dlt.conf - DLT daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The DLT daemon is the central application which gathers logs and traces
from different applications, stores them temporarily or permanently and
transfers them to a DLT client application, which could run directly on the
GENIVI system or more likely on some external tester device.

The configuration file dlt.conf allows to configure the different
runtime behaviour of the dlt-daemon. It is loaded during startup of dlt-daemon.

By default dlt-daemon loads the file /etc/dlt.conf. An
alternative configuration file can be loaded with the option -c.

GENERAL OPTIONS
---------------

*Daemonize*::
    If set to 1 DLT daemon is started in background as daemon. This option
    is only needed in System V init systems. In systemd based startup
    systems the daemon is started by spawning own process.

    Default: 0

*SendSerialHeader*::
    If set to 1 DLT daemon sends each DLT message to the client with
    prepanding the serial header "DLS0x01".

    Default: 0

*SendContextRegistration*::
    If set to 1 each context which is registered from an application in the
    DLT daemon generates a message to inform the DLT client about the new
    context.

    Default: 0

*SendMessageTime*::
    If set to 1 DLt daemon sends each second a DLT control message to the
    client with the current timestamp from the system.

    Default: 0

*ECUId*::
    This value sets the ECU Id, which is sent with each DLT message.

    Default: ECU1

*SharedMemorySize*::
    This value sets the size of the shared memory, which is used to exchange
    DLT messages between applications and daemon. This value is defined in
    bytes. If this value is changed the system must be rebooted to take
    effect.

    Default: 100000

*PersistanceStoragePath*::
    This is the directory path, where the DLT daemon stores its runtime
    configuration. Runtime configuration includes stored log levels, trace
    status and changed logging mode.

    Default: /tmp

*LoggingMode*::
    The logging console for internal logging of dlt-daemon. +
    0 = log to stdout, 1 = log to syslog, 2 = log to file (see LoggingFilename)

    Default: 0

*LoggingLevel*::
    The internal log level, up to which logs are written. +
    LOG_EMERG = 0, LOG_ALERT = 1, LOG_CRIT = 2, LOG_ERR = 3, LOG_WARNING = 4, LOG_NOTICE = 5, LOG_INFO = 6, LOG_DEBUG = 7

    Default: 6

*LoggingFilename*::
    If LoggingMode is set to 2 logs are written to the file path given here.

    Default: /tmp/dlt.log

*TimeOutOnSend*::
    Socket timeout in seconds for sending to clients.

    Default: 4

*RingbufferMinSize*::
    The minimum size of the Ringbuffer, used for storing temporary DLT messages, until client is connected.

    Default: 500000

*RingbufferMaxSize*::
    The max size of the Ringbuffer, used for storing temporary DLT messages, until client is connected.

    Default: 10000000

*RingbufferStepSize*::
    The step size the Ringbuffer is increased, used for storing temporary DLT messages, until client is connected.

    Default: 500000

*ContextLogLevel*::
    Initial log-level that is sent when an application registers. +
    DLT_LOG_OFF = 0, DLT_LOG_FATAL = 1, DLT_LOG_ERROR = 2, DLT_LOG_WARN = 3, DLT_LOG_INFO = 4, DLT_LOG_DEBUG = 5, DLT_LOG_VERBOSE = 6

    Default: 4

*ContextTraceStatus*::
    Initial trace-status that is sent when an application registers. +
    DLT_TRACE_STATUS_OFF = 0, DLT_TRACE_STATUS_ON = 1

    Default: 0

*ForceContextLogLevelAndTraceStatus*::
    Force log level and trace status of contexts to not exceed "ContextLogLevel" and "ContextTraceStatus". +
    If set to 1 (ON) whenever a context registers or changes the log-level it has to be lower or equal to ContextLogLevel.

    Default: 0

GATEWAY CONFIGURATION
---------------------

*GatewayMode*::
    Enable Gateway mode

    Default: 0

*GatewayConfigFile*::
    Read gateway configuration from another location

    Default: /etc/dlt_gateway.conf

CONTROL APPLICATION OPTIONS
---------------------------

*ControlSocketPath*::
    Path to control socket.

    Default: /tmp/dlt-ctrl.sock

OFFLINE TRACE OPTIONS
---------------------

*OfflineTraceDirectory*::
    If this option is set, offline trace is enabled. This value sets the
    directory path to the offline trace memory. The directory must already
    exist.

    Default: Offline tracing is disabled.

*OfflineTraceFileSize*::
    This value defines the max size of a offline trace file, if offline trace
    is enabled. This value is defined in bytes. If the files size of the
    current used log file is exceeded, a new log file is created.

    Default: 1000000

*OfflineTraceMaxSize*::
    This value defines the max offline Trace memory size, if offline trace
    is enabled. This value is defined in bytes. If the overall offline trace
    size is excedded, the oldest log files are deleted, until a new trace
    file fits the overall offline trace max size.

    Default: 4000000

*OfflineTraceFileNameTimestampBased*::
    Filename timestamp based or index based. +
    1 = timestamp based, 0 = index based

    Default: 1

    RS232DeviceName must be set to enable serial logging.

    Default: 115200

*RS232SyncSerialHeader*::
    If serial logging is enabled, each received DLT message is checked to
    contain a serial header. If the DLT message contains no serial header,
    the message is ignored.

    Default: Function is disabled

TCP CLIENT OPTIONS
