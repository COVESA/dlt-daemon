Package: dlt-daemon
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace daemon
 This component provides a standardised log and trace interface, based
 on the standardised protocol specified in the AUTOSAR standard 4.0 DLT.
 This component can be used by COVESA components and other applications
 as logging facility providing
 .
 The DLT daemon is the central component in COVESA, which gathers all
 logs and traces from the DLT user applications. The logs and traces
 are stored optionally directly in a file in the ECU. The DLT daemon
 forwards all logs and traces to a connected DLT client.
 The DLT client can send control messages to the daemon, e.g. to set
 individual log levels of applications and contexts or get the list of
 applications and contexts registered in the DLT daemon.


Package: libdlt2
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace daemon - Library
 DLT library is used by apps that need to log to a DLT daemon directly and by
 apps that want to read logs from DLT daemon.


Package: libdlt-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libdlt2
Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace daemon - Headers
 DLT library is used by apps that need to log to a DLT daemon directly and by

 files.


Package: dlt-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: libdlt2, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace daemon - Tools
 This package includes tools to connect to and experiment with DLT daemon.
 Most usefully this includes 'dlt-receive' to connect to a (remote) DLT server
 and save all logs to a DLT file and 'dlt-system' that injects system logs
 into the DLT server.


Package: dlt-examples
Architecture: any
Depends: libdlt2, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace daemon - Examples
 This package includes example binaries to demonstrate several use cases.
